Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Somehow when the simulations is below 10000 it's almost constant time, however when more simulations are done, then the slope is exponential, not linear.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10000 simulations is good enough, after that the fee would become too high.
